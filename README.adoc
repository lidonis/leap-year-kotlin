= Leap year kata in Kotlin
:icons: font

== Goal
This repository should be an example of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development[TDD] with each commit representing one step in the process.
It will be written using the https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin] language and using https://kotest.io/[Kotest] as test framework

== Rules

Implement a function that checks if a year is a leap year.

The function should return true if a year is a leap year, and false if it is not.

NOTE: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400


== Examples

- 2021 is not a leap year (not divisible by 4)
- 2020 is a leap year (divisible by 4)
- 2000 is a leap year (divisible by 400)
- 1900 is not a leap year (divisible by 4, divisible by 100, NOT divisible by 400)
